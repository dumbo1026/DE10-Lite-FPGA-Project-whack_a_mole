A simple whack_a_mole game practiced on DE10-Lite Broad using Verilog module

There are five seperated modules in the whack_a_mole .v file that haven't been completed.

The five group members that haven't been arranged to a work have to choose one of the five incompleted module to work with.

If one's work is finished, you can send the code to me by LINE or Github, I'll update the code as soon as possible.

That's it

I don't know what else I can write
