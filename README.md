# DE10-Lite-FPGA-Project-whack_a_mole
A simple whack_a_mole game practiced on DE10-Lite Broad using Verilog module

There are five seperated modules in the whack_a_mole .v file that haven't been completed
The five group members that have been chosen to complete the code have to choose one of the five incompleted module to work with
If one's work is finished, you can send the code to me by LINE or Gothub, I'll update the code as soon as possible

That's it
I don't know what else I can write
